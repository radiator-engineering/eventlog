# run-reactor.sh — supervisor for any log reactor.
#
# Keeps a reactor alive across crashes: if it exits for any reason other than
# "another instance already holds the lock" (exit 3) or a clean Ctrl+C, it is
# respawned after a short pause, and the restart is recorded in the log so the
# gap is auditable. Run this FOREGROUNDED in the reactor's herdr pane:
#   bash .context/bin/run-reactor.sh                        # committer (default)
#   bash .context/bin/run-reactor.sh doc-sync-reactor.sh    # doc worker
# The argument is a script name in this directory or an absolute path.
#
# What it cannot survive: the pane, herdr session, or machine going away. After
# a reboot, run the line above again — the reactor resumes from its last ack.
