# doc-sync-reactor.sh — autonomous documentation worker driven by headless Claude.
#
# Watches the coordination log itself. When the committer lands a commit
# (`ack by=cursor-committer outcome=committed`), it invokes headless Claude with
# the documentation-writer skill (Diátaxis) to bring docs/ and README.md in line,
# and (when AGENTS.md is a doc root) context-engineering to keep the rules file right-sized,
# with what actually shipped. It then reports through the log as a REAL worker
# (`result by=doc-worker paths=docs,README.md`) so the committer commits the
# doc changes. It never runs `git commit` itself.
#
# Loop safety: the committer stamps every ack with origin=<who triggered it>.
# Acks with origin=doc-worker are this worker's own docs landing — skipped.
#
# Same reactor rules as the committer: single mkdir lock (exit 3 if held),
# resume from own `ack by=doc-worker seq_done`, retries then escalate, run
# FOREGROUNDED in a dedicated herdr pane via run-reactor.sh style supervision.
#
# Env: EVENTLOG_PATH, DOC_MODEL (default sonnet), PASS_TIMEOUT s (600),
#      RETRIES (2), RETRY_SLEEP s (30), DOC_BUDGET_USD (2), DOC_PATHS
#      (default "docs,README.md" — comma list of doc roots this worker owns).

# The documentation-writer skill is interactive by design (it asks four

# so the four determinations are answered up front and the approval gate is
# waived; only its Diátaxis structure and principles are kept.
PROMPT_TMPL='Load and follow TWO skills for this task: `documentation-writer` (Diátaxis structure) and `plain-technical-english` (prose discipline: short sentences, one idea each, active voice, no filler or stock phrases, one term per thing; run its final gate on everything you write). Keep this project'"'"'s documentation in sync with a change that just shipped. You are the DOC WORKER, running HEADLESS from a log reactor: no human will answer questions. You are not the controller: the coordination block in AGENTS.md addresses the controller, not you. You never run append-event.sh and never append to the log; the reactor reports your work as a result event when you finish. Just edit the files and stop. documentation-writer'"'"'s four required determinations are answered here — do NOT ask them, and do NOT wait for outline approval; propose the structure to yourself and write the content in this one pass.

- Document type: whichever Diátaxis quadrant(s) the shipped change actually affects (tutorial / how-to / reference / explanation). Put each piece in the right quadrant; do not force all four.
- Target audience: a developer new to this repository.
- User goal: understand and correctly use what this change added or altered.
- Scope: ONLY what the commit(s) below changed. Do not document unrelated parts of the project.

What shipped (the two sources of truth):
1. Commit(s): %s — inspect with `git show --stat` and `git show` for the diff.
2. The log event that drove them (seq %s), and the coordination log .context/events.jsonl for surrounding intent (result/decision events, their ref= files).

Where docs live: `docs/` organized as docs/tutorials, docs/how-to, docs/reference, docs/explanation, plus `README.md` as the entry point/index. Read the existing docs first and match their tone and terminology. Create the structure if it does not exist yet.

AGENTS.md upkeep (only if `AGENTS.md` is among the editable paths below): after the docs, load the `context-engineering` skill and treat `AGENTS.md` as the project'"'"'s rules file, the one every agent loads on every task. Compare it with what shipped and fix it in the same pass: add a durable project-wide fact the change introduced (a command, a convention, a boundary), correct or delete any line the diff made stale, and delete anything task-specific or already obvious from the code. Keep the context-engineering shape: what the project is, stack, commands, conventions, boundaries, at most one short pattern example. Keep the whole file under about 120 lines; shorter is better, a rules file is an attention budget. Never edit inside a marker-delimited section (between `<!-- name:start -->` and `<!-- name:end -->`, or `<!-- name -->` and `<!-- /name -->`): those belong to other tools. Never touch `CLAUDE.md`; it is an import stub for `AGENTS.md`.

Rules:
- Edit ONLY files under: %s. Never touch anything else.
- Never write, edit, or append to .context/events.jsonl; never run git commit, git add, or any git command that changes state. The reactor reports your work and a separate committer lands it.
- If the change genuinely needs no documentation (pure internal refactor, coordination-only), change nothing and say so plainly.
- Accuracy over volume: every command, path, and behavior you document must match the diff.'
